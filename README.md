# SMS Spam Detection with NLP 🚫📩  

This repository provides a comprehensive implementation of an SMS spam detection system powered by Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The primary objective is to accurately classify SMS messages as either spam or ham (non-spam), ensuring efficient communication and protecting users from unwanted messages.

## Key Features 🌟  

1. **Data Preprocessing**:  
   - Text normalization with removal of special characters, numbers, and conversion to lowercase. 🔧  
   - Advanced tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization for optimized text processing. 🧹  

2. **Feature Engineering**:  
   - Transform textual data into numerical vectors using **TF-IDF** and **Count Vectorizer** techniques. 📊  

3. **Model Training & Evaluation**:  
   - Employ classification algorithms like **Logistic Regression**, **Naive Bayes**, and **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**. 🤖  
   - Robust evaluation using metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. 📈  

4. **Seamless Integration**:  
   - Modular code structure for flexibility in extending or replacing components. 🛠️  

5. **Visualization**:  
   - Intuitive performance graphs for better understanding and presentation. 📉

## How It Works 🚀  

### *1. Data Preprocessing*:  
   - Raw SMS data is cleaned, tokenized, and normalized.  
   - Lemmatization ensures text retains meaning while reducing dimensionality.  

### *2. Feature Extraction*:  
   - Extract meaningful patterns with **CountVectorizer** or **TF-IDF Vectorizer** to convert text into numerical form.  

### *3. Model Training*:  
   - Train classifiers like Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and SVM using the processed data.  

### *4. Evaluation*:  
   - Evaluate models using statistical metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score).  
   - Visualize performance with comparative analysis charts.
