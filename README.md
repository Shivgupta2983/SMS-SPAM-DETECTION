This repository implements a machine learning-based SMS spam detection system using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The goal is to classify SMS messages as either spam or ham (non-spam). 🚫📩

##Features 🌟:
1]Preprocessing of SMS data for text normalization 🔧
2]Tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization 🧹
3]Feature extraction using TF-IDF or Count Vectorizer 📊
4]Model training using classification algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM) 🤖
5]Evaluation with metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score 📈

##Technologies Used 💻
1]Python 🐍
2]Libraries: scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, nltk, matplotlib 📚
3]Jupyter Notebook (for easy execution and visualization) 📓

##Dataset 📦
This project uses a labeled dataset containing SMS messages categorized as "spam" or "ham." You can download a sample dataset from source. 📥


##Installation ⚙️
1]Clone this repository
2]Copy code
3]Install the required dependencies:
      pip install -r requirements.txt

##Usage 🚀
1]Download the dataset (if you haven't already) and save it in the data/ directory. 🗂️
2]Run the Jupyter notebook or Python scripts:
3]Train the model using the provided scripts and evaluate its performance. 📊

##How It Works 🛠️
1]Data Preprocessing:

   * SMS messages are cleaned by removing special characters, numbers, and converting text to lowercase. ✂️
   * Stopwords are removed, and text is tokenized and lemmatized for better feature extraction. 🧠

2]Feature Extraction:

  *Text data is converted into numerical format using CountVectorizer or TfidfVectorizer. 🔢

3]Model Training:

   *Machine learning models like Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) are trained on the extracted features. 🤓

4]Evaluation:

  *The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. 📊
